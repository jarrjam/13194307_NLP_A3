# 13194307_NLP_A3
Repo for NLP A3. Group Members: Jamil Daher (13194307), Nathan Tran (13244607), Daniel Guo (13189675)

Each Python notebook contains the code to run the experiments on a specific dataset.

The other folders in this repo are:
- Datasets: contains files for each dataset
- Lda: contains saved LDA topic distributions, so that they do not need to be recreated every time the experiments are run.
